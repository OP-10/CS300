# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problems i was solving in project one was finding out which data structure was most efficent for the program by runing a analisis of the run-time and memory
 of each data structure. I found out that the vercotr was the most efficent. For project two i had to make a program that woul read a file, chech if the file has the correct format. Then their would be a option to see the list of corses. Then it would allow the user to search for a course with the corse id nad provide the user with information on the course and its prereqs.
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The way i approched this problem was by finding out the most efficent data sructure. Then i used that information to implement said data structure into my program to make it rune as efficently as possible.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The way i overcame any roadblock i ran into was to first take my time, and think abougt what could be causing the isse. I would use problem solving and look through my code where the issue is to find a soulution. Another way is to ask your peers for help and advice.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project has shown me that its important to keep your code clean and efficent. This helps not only you, but your peers and the client too. It allows your peers to understand your code better and avoids issues down the road. It also makes the program run faster and more efficent which improves the experience of the user.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has made me write more clean and optimized code, it also showed me that using any mothod of geting the job done is not the best way of doing things and wrtiting efficent code is important. It also made me write more in line comments and other optimizations that i didnt do as much before.
